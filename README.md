What is open source and why? Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software embrace strong values of community, collaboration, and transparency, for the mutual benefit of the platform and its users. Other than that, it is more cost-effective, flexible, and secure.
